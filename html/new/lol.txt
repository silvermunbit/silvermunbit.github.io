ARTICLES

leftover k from devoiced demonstrative as an epenthetic consonant

if FRONT: Vko       (V if word ends in C)
if BACK:            (V if word ends in cluster, B, s, L)
N O Vkä <Vcha>
S W Vke <Vche>
E Vkän <Vchaw̃>

STARTING FROM THE DEMONSTRATIVE <*gä>
- devoiced to <kä>
- through dissimilation goes to <ka> after FRONT vowels
- leveled after FRONT vowels to the SOUTH <ko>
- after BACK vowels:
    - N käl > kä (cha)
    - S kä + e > käe > ke (che)
    - W kä + i > käi > ke
    - E kä + n > kän (chaw̃)
    - O kä
    (N merges O <kä>, S merges W <ke>)
- epenthetic vowels added (for <ko>: after C, for others: after clusters, B, s, L)

used:
- typically with set nouns
- with some proper nouns
- used with question clauses (i don't know the where of his going)
- used with other things (tbd)

TODO

rethink what i want to do with gender, especially when thinking about compounds
rethink the article, perhaps make it a normal definite article
with gender, put the ending somehow at the end in compounds
do articles and demonstratives after the noun as they should be

find some special uses for the article
negation, impersonal constructions

x/y - x used before hard consonants, y used before soft consonants
V - the following vowel (sV + sata > sasata)
apply umlaut whenever necessary

add -s- to the script because of new word-internal clusters
change the conjugation of torn > norn

change the vowel hiatus rule to encompass all instances of the first vowel becoming a glide
with cases, add that the inanimate ones are used in all unclear instances? something like the default form, because these can be used in other cases as well

k(u)-(u)s - person suffix from kus "person" - should be a circumfix
